# 2048 in Rust

This is a near-clone of the popular game 2048. It has been written in my rust beginnings. Modified a bit later for better terminal interaction.

This was my very first rust project, so please excuse any dubious code you may see here.

As there the project is small (and in one file) i didn't bother to comment much of it, it should be relatively self-explanatory.

Crates used:
- [crossterm 0.28.1](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm)
- [rand 0.8.5](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/)

## Download & Running

Make sure you have rust installed. Then just clone the repository and type in the terminal ```cargo run```.
